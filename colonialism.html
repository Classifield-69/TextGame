    <h2>Memorandum Opinion</h2>
     <p>
           The High Court of Australia’s decision in Mabo v Queensland (No 2) was groundbreaking, delivering a detailed analysis that fundamentally altered Australian property law by recognizing native title and rejecting the long-standing doctrine of terra nullius. The Court, in a 6-1 majority, held that the Meriam people had a continuing native title to their lands on the Murray Islands, as their traditional laws and customs regarding land had survived British annexation.
        </p>
        <p>
           The judgment emphasized that the common law of Australia could recognize native title where Indigenous peoples had maintained their connection to the land under their traditional laws and customs. The Court noted, however, that native title could coexist with the Crown's sovereignty unless explicitly extinguished by legislation or inconsistent land grants.

  <div id="plaintiffArg" class="plaintiffArg">
      <p>The plaintiffs argued that the Meriam people’s native title to the Murray Islands predated British colonization and was not lawfully extinguished. They contended that the doctrine of terra nullius was a legal and historical fiction that failed to recognize the existence of Indigenous societies with complex land governance systems. The plaintiffs emphasized that the Crown’s sovereignty did not automatically nullify native title, which could coexist with the Crown’s underlying title unless explicitly extinguished. They argued for justice and reconciliation, seeking acknowledgment of their rights to preserve their cultural heritage and rectify historical injustices.

      <p>The defendants asserted that the doctrine of terra nullius was the legal foundation of Australia’s land law, justifying the Crown’s acquisition of sovereignty and extinguishment of any pre-existing land rights. They argued that recognizing native title would undermine established property systems, creating uncertainty and potential disruptions. The defendants also contended that the Meriam people’s connection to the land was insufficient to sustain a legal claim, as traditional customs were not universally observed or documented. They maintained that the Crown’s sovereignty inherently nullified any pre-existing Indigenous land rights, leaving no room for recognition of native title.

    <div id="plaintiffEvi" class="plaintiffEvi">
      <p>The plaintiffs, led by Eddie Mabo, presented extensive historical, anthropological, and oral evidence. Anthropological studies revealed the Meriam people’s distinct cultural identity, governed by traditional laws and customs that included systems of land ownership, inheritance, and use. Oral histories, passed down by community elders, illustrated their deep spiritual and cultural ties to the land, including the concept of land stewardship. Historical documents, such as accounts from missionaries and colonial administrators, corroborated the Meriam people’s continuous occupation and governance of the Murray Islands before and after British annexation. This evidence demonstrated an unbroken connection to the land and adherence to longstanding customs.

      <p>The defendants, the State of Queensland, relied on legal precedents and historical interpretations supporting the doctrine of terra nullius. They argued that the annexation of the Murray Islands in 1879 vested absolute ownership of the land in the Crown. Evidence included colonial-era laws and administrative records that treated the land as unoccupied and subject to settlement. The defendants presented documents showing Crown land grants and developments, which they argued were inconsistent with the continued existence of native title.

             <h2>Case Summary</h2>
      <p>In Mabo v Queensland (No 2) [1992] HCA 23, the High Court of Australia recognized the concept of native title, overturning the doctrine of terra nullius, which had previously deemed Australia as land belonging to no one at the time of British colonization. The plaintiffs, led by Eddie Mabo, argued for the land rights of the Meriam people of the Murray Islands in the Torres Strait. The Court's decision acknowledged that Indigenous Australians have rights to land that predate colonial sovereignty and that these rights could continue to exist under Australian law, provided they had not been extinguished by valid governmental action. This landmark ruling led to the establishment of the Native Title Act 1993, creating a framework for Indigenous Australians to claim traditional rights to unalienated land. The Mabo case fundamentally altered Australian property law and was a significant step toward recognizing Indigenous Australians' rights and connection to their ancestral lands.</p>

   <h2>Real life outcome</h2>
   <p>The real-life outcome of Mabo v Queensland (No 2) [1992] HCA 23 was transformative for Australia, as it led to the recognition of native title rights for Indigenous Avalians and the abolition of the doctrine of terra nullius, which had denied their traditional land ownership. The landmark decision directly influenced the creation of the Native Title Act 1993, which established a legal framework for Indigenous Australians to claim rights to land based on traditional laws and customs. This ruling was a significant milestone in advancing Indigenous land rights and reconciliation, but it also sparked debates about property rights and the extent of native title claims. While the case empowered Indigenous communities to assert their connection to land, challenges such as proving continuous traditional connection and navigating legal complexities remain significant obstacles in practice. Overall, the Mabo decision marked a critical step toward justice and recognition for Australia's First Nations people.</p>
