      The U.S. Department of the Interior and the BLM approved the Converse County Oil and Gas Project,
      affecting over 52,000 acres in Wyoming. Plaintiffs argued that the Environmental Impact
      Statement (EIS) used faulty data to estimate groundwater impacts, specifically by inflating the

   <h2>Memorandum Opinion</h2>
     <p>
            This case involves a challenge to the decision made by the Secretary of the Interior regarding the approval of a Record of Decision authorizing a large-scale drilling project in the Powder River Basin, Wyoming. The project encompasses approximately 52,667 acres of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administered surface and federal mineral estate and includes plans for the drilling of approximately 500 wells per year over a period of ten years. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The BLM conducted an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to analyze the anticipated environmental effects of the project, particularly focusing on the effects on groundwater supplies. The case highlights concerns regarding the specific storage value used in the groundwater model, which the plaintiff argues is significantly higher than values found in existing studies, potentially leading to an underestimation of groundwater drawdown effects.
        </p>
        <p>
            The dispute includes the implications of federal agency decisions on environmental regulations and resource management, with the plaintiff seeking to challenge the adequacy of the EIS and the decision-making process leading to the approval of the drilling project.

    </div>  

    <div id="plaintiffEvi" class="plaintiffEvi" >
      <p>Before finalizing the EIS, BLM first publicized a draft and allowed interested entities to comment.

The plaintiff pointed out that BLM used a specific storage value of 0.001 for the groundwater model, citing a 2014 Powder River Basin report. However, that report lists specific storage values in a much lower range (from 0.78 E-08 to 1.20 E-07). This difference was critical to their argument, as it suggested a potential underestimation of groundwater drawdown by a factor of 10,000.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in its comments on the draft EIS, noted that BLM used “what appears to be an unrepresentatively high specific storage value (by at least an order of magnitude),” which “may result in a substantial underestimation of both the magnitude and extent of drawdown caused by pumping.”

While BLM relied on a 2014 report for the specific storage value, the plaintiffs pointed to discrepancies in other reports, like a 2006 report that listed specific storage values in the range of 6.4 E-08 through 0.11, which are more consistent with industry standards and previous studies.

</p>
      <button onclick="location.href='#evidence_arguments'" class="goBack">Go back</button>

    </div>

    <div id="defendantEvi" class="defendantEvi" >
      <p>The defendants justified the use of the specific storage value of 0.001 by citing previous groundwater modeling efforts conducted for the Powder River Basin Coal Review. They argued that the value was consistent with previous studies and was appropriate for use in the EIS.

The defendants also pointed to a 2006 report, which included a range of specific storage values between 6.4 E-08 through 0.11. This report encompassed the 0.001 value that BLM used in its groundwater modeling, providing further justification that their approach was within the scientifically accepted range.

In response to the EPA’s criticism of the specific storage value being too high, BLM reiterated that it had derived the value from prior Powder River Basin groundwater modeling studies. BLM did not change the value but instead explained that the use of 0.001 was consistent with established practices.

BLM defended its compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), arguing that the EIS was comprehensive, including public comments and addressing concerns raised during the review process. They claimed that their responses to public and agency comments, including those from the EPA, were sufficient.

    <div id="plaintiffArg" class="plaintiffArg">
      <p>Groundwater Drawdown Underestimated: Plaintiffs argue that the BLM made a significant error in estimating groundwater drawdown. The EIS relied on a specific storage value of 0.001, which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) flagged as “unrepresentatively high (by at least an order of magnitude),” resulting in a “substantial underestimation of both the magnitude and extent of drawdown caused by pumping.” The plaintiffs highlighted that BLM derived the specific storage value from a 2014 Powder River Basin report, but that report actually lists values “ranging from 0.78 E-08 to 1.20 E-07,” meaning the value used in the EIS was off by “a factor of 10,000.”

Error in Groundwater Model: Plaintiffs pointed out that BLM’s response to the EPA’s comment continued to cite the 2014 Powder River Basin report to defend its use of the 0.001 value, even though the numbers from that report didn’t support it. The plaintiffs claimed this was a clear error in the model that minimized the risk of groundwater depletion.

Violation of Environmental Laws: Plaintiffs alleged that in approving the Converse County Oil and Gas Project, BLM violated several environmental laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), and the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA). They argued that BLM’s failure to accurately assess environmental impacts, particularly groundwater depletion, was a violation of these statutes, which require thorough environmental review and consideration of public lands' sustainable use.

Failure to Consider Mitigating Measures: Plaintiffs contended that because BLM underestimated the groundwater drawdown, it likely provided for “fewer mitigating measures than it would have otherwise” when approving the project, leading to greater environmental harm.

    <div id="defendantArg" class="defendantArg">
      <p>Use of Prior Groundwater Studies: The defendants (U.S. Department of the Interior and BLM) argued that the specific storage value of 0.001 used in the groundwater model was appropriate and supported by the 2006 Powder River Basin report. They acknowledged the EPA’s concerns but maintained that their methodology, including the 0.001 storage value, was based on “available scientific literature” and past studies of the Powder River Basin.
Scientific Discretion: Defendants emphasized that BLM exercised its scientific discretion in choosing the 0.001 value, relying not only on the 2014 report but also other historical data, including the 2006 report, which contained a range of values that encompassed the 0.001 storage value. They argued that this discretion in selecting data points fell within their authority to interpret the scientific evidence available.
No Significant Environmental Harm: The defendants contended that the environmental impact of the Converse County Oil and Gas Project was properly analyzed and that the groundwater drawdown would not be as severe as the plaintiffs claimed. They argued that the model used in the EIS sufficiently considered the potential impacts on water resources, wildlife, and air quality.
Standing and Scope: The defendants also questioned the plaintiffs’ standing to bring certain challenges, particularly in relation to the approval of individual drilling permits (APDs). They argued that while plaintiffs may have standing to challenge the project as a whole, they did not have standing to contest the approval of specific APDs. Furthermore, they maintained that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated any likely “irreparable harm” from the project’s approval.
APA and Legal Framework: Defendants argued that under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the BLM’s decision-making process should be reviewed under a “highly deferential” standard. The APA instructs courts to set aside an agency’s decision only if it is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” They argued that BLM followed proper procedures and provided a rational basis for its decisions in approving the project.

 <div class="RealLife" id="RealLife">
   <h2>Real life outcome</h2>
   <p>In September 2024, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan ruled that the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) approval of the Converse County Oil and Gas Project in Wyoming's Powder River Basin was illegal due to significant errors in groundwater modeling. The BLM's analysis used a specific storage value that was off by a factor of 10,000, leading to a substantial underestimation of groundwater depletion. 

As a result, the court halted the approval of new drilling permits for the project until a more accurate environmental review is conducted. This decision emphasizes the importance of precise environmental assessments in large-scale energy projects to ensure the protection of natural resources and compliance with environmental laws.</p>
